# Memento
A Minecraft mod that tracks stats for items and displays them along with offering rewards for achieving certain milestones.

## Scope & Limitations
Memento is designed to track the history of unique, unstackable items (Tools, Weapons, Armor, Elytra, etc.).

**It does NOT track stats for stackable items** (e.g., "Ender Pearls Thrown" or "Bread Eaten").
* **Reasoning:** Merging statistics when stacks are combined or split creates ambiguity and dilutes the concept of a specific item having a "history."
* **Target:** This mod focuses on "Hero Items"—gear that you repair, rename, and keep with you throughout your journey.
